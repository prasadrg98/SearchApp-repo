I am seeing in the log that the signout is being triggered after the Jabber is discovering new presence servers and prompting to sign out:

This is happening due to the nature of the additional discovery with CUPLOGIN SRV records in place, which causes a change to the currently used IM&P server and results in us being prompted to sign out and sign back in.

Currently you are not utilizing cisco-uds records:

We discovered it was a configuration issue, since the non-working call was being routed to the SME, which was not correct. We discovered that there was an ILS route that was being learned from CL47.
 
So to fix this we went to the CSS and added Cu1-DirNum-PT in the CSS and moved the learned partition to the last place (Cu1-PreISR-PT) so it didn?t had much priority.
After changing this in the CUCM, all calls started to work for all the users that had the issue.

In reviewing these Server's we noticed that the SQL Profiler shows that the highest reads and writes and in turn CPU load was coming from the CCDM application (Cisco Contact Center Domain Manager). We are not sure if this is a coincidence or related but this CPU overload issue on the Cisco AWHDS Servers also started after we resolved an issue with CCDM that quit working. We had opened a case with Cisco TAC to resolve the CCDM issue as it turned out that CCDM database had filled up the Disk and eGain along with TAC had us increase the disk size for the CCDM Database which we did and this resolved the CCDM issue, but right after this the UCCE AWHDS A side server started showing High CPU utilization and locked up and we had to reboot the server as CUIC Reports couldn't be run. Once we rebooted the A side AWHDS server, the CUIC reports were working again but now the B side AWHDS started showing High CPU the very next day.

It seems that at some point your device is changing the DNS server that it?s using and it?s failing afterwards until it restarts the whole login process.

Synopsis: A TFTP server is listening on the remote host.

Description: The remote host has a TFTP server installed that is serving one or more Cisco CallManager files. These files do not themselves include any sensitive information, but do identify the TFTP server as being part of a Cisco CallManager environment. The CCM TFTP server is an essential part of providing VOIP handset functionality, so should not be exposed to unnecessary scrutiny.""

Solution: If it is not required, disable or uninstall the TFTP server. Otherwise restrict access to trusted sources only.",SOLUTION SUPPORT - 19507 - Cisco CallManager TFTP File Detection (CCM Devices),TTEC CONSULTING INC,Voice - Communications Manager,Communications Manager Event Log Errors / Alarms,Customer Education,11.5.1,"This is the vulnerability or CVE which you are looking for :
 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-7030

Please note this is a disputed advisory as TFTP is an essential part of the architecture and is working as design.
Cisco didn't request this CVE-ID and we dispute that it is even a vulnerability.  It is service detection.
A mitigation already exists to safeguard against the potential for information disclosure as a result of this design, by using encrypted TFTP Phone configuration files, which can be enabled via the following:

From CUCM:

From Cisco Unified CM administration page go to -- > Bulk Administration -- > Phones -- > Update Phones -- > Query
 
       In this list you can either choose one phone or a set of phones from the search to force the log out ( choose one phone for testing purposes, and choose all  when you want to set the settings for all phones)
 
       Press next, in this page we don?t want to change anything ( we only want to create an empty query just to force the phones to logout from EM) check the picture below:

       Find the job you just created  (check the Submit Date Time<javascript:onColumnFindSubmit(%22batjob.submitdatetime%22,%22true%22)> to find which one)
 
       In that Job scheduler configure the following ( as seen below)

       In the scheduled Date Time choose time to match 18:00:00 ( if your system clock is different than the phone clock, make sure to make the appropriate adjustments to match 6 PM)

       Save and activate Job.

In short it?s not possible to get this information precisely.
 
Some information is stored in DB but it?s per Phone and not EM  profile. So in some cases you can?t say for sure.
 
However you can find these information useful:
 
Getting EM information from Cisco Unified Reporting.
 
CUCM allows to get some information from reporting:
 
A screenshot of a cell phone

Description automatically generated
 
However it provides very limited information. We can see some basic information like number of phones with EM enabled, logged in users etc. 
 
Getting additional information using SQL.
 
EM related information is stored in a ""extensionmobilitydynamic"" table. It's important to understand that raws are created  in it when you enable EM on a device ( phone etc.):
 
 
 
So if we want to count all the devices in that table you can run : 
 
admin:run sql select count(*) from extensionmobilitydynamic
(count(*))
==========
30     
 
If we want to see all devices we can do:
 
admin:run sql select dv.name from extensionmobilitydynamic emd inner join device dv on emd.fkdevice = dv.pkid
name            
===============
SEPB678AC554336
SEP001C58FB055D
SEP655645765765
MARIO           
SEP04FE7F688D5C
....
 
Or search for a specific one: 
 
admin:run sql select dv.name from extensionmobilitydynamic emd inner join device dv on emd.fkdevice = dv.pkid where dv.name == 'SEPE8B74837E3C3'
name            
===============
SEPE8B74837E3C3
 
If we want to get similar output to a CUCM gui report with all logged in users we can run: 
 
admin:run sql select eu.userid,DBINFO('utc_to_datetime', emd.logintime) as logintime,emd.loginduration, dv.name from extensionmobilitydynamic emd inner join device dv on emd.fkdevice = dv.pkid inner join enduser eu on emd.fkenduser = eu.pkid
userid logintime             loginduration name

alex   2018-03-20 11:48:07.0 0             SEPE8B74837E3C3
 
One important thing is that fkenduser contains enduser pkid when user is logged in. When user is not logged in into a phone it's set to NULL :
 
admin:run sql select dv.name , emd.fkenduser from extensionmobilitydynamic emd inner join device dv on emd.fkdevice = dv.pkid
name            fkenduser                            
=============== ====================================

SEP001E4AF0DBDA NULL                                 
SEP001C58FB055D NULL
 
Another important information is fkenduser_lastlogin and datetimestamp. We  can get infromation about the last user logged in to a phone. Also we can get a timestamp. 
 
admin:run sql select eu.userid,DBINFO('utc_to_datetime', emd.datetimestamp) as datetimestamp, dv.name from extensionmobilitydynamic emd inner join device dv on emd.fkdevice = dv.pkid inner join enduser eu on emd.fkenduser_lastlogin = eu.pkid
userid datetimestamp         name

drv    2016-02-23 00:04:30.0 SEP503DE57D7812
 
datetimestamp specifies logout date and time. This information is updated only when user logs out. So you can see different users for currently logged in and the last logged out. 
 
Understanding limitations of SQL infromation from extentionmobilitydynamic table.
 
Some customers would like to identify users which didn't use EM for a long time. It can't be done because if we don't see a user logged in or we don't see a user logged out it doesn't mean that he is not using EM. This table is based on devices with EM enabled. So here is example: 
 
User1 logs in to a Phone1
User1 logs out from Phone1 
User2 logs in to Phone1
User2 logs out from Phone1 
 
So we don't see any infromation related to User1 using EM on a Phone1.",Closed

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
We are trying to upgrade all the jabbers from our customer to 12.7.1 version due some cisco bugs.
The installation and testing on windows worked fine without any issue but the testing on MACOS(Mojave) has revealed some issues.
1.	Keychain issue related to com.cisco.jabber.encrypt-key still exist. User will continuously be prompted to enter password. Only way to supress is to deny 4-5 times before you are able to continue.
2.	Once you are able to proceed to the below screen you are initially able to login but it doesn?t save the credentials so every time the user quits they need to renter their username and password. This was not the case in 12.5.
The screenshots are attached in the case.

What is the Complete CUC Version?
-   Version 11.5.1.16900-16
        Do you have secure integration either with SIP or SCCP?
        Please go to Cisco Unity Connection Administration page.
o   Go to Telephony integrations>> Port group >> Click on Port group and send me a screenshot of this page.
       
Did you start receiving this alert after upgrading the CUC to 11.5.1SU6 or higher version? yes
When did this alert start getting generated? From yesterday
Did you perform any upgrade? Yes
Are you getting this alert on both the nodes or only 1? Only on PUB
Could you please share the snippet of the complete Alert that you received on RTMT?
  
How frequently are you seeing this alert? Daily 2 times
What is the business impact? NO Impact as of now

######

I did some research on this. That is an alert from RTMT, the Appid CuLicMgrSvr is for license issue and the Alarm type CucStopEncryption is for encryption.
 
The issue seems to be due to export control feature functionality which appears from unity connection 11.5 SU3 onwards, the RTMT alert was added from SU6 version. Hence if you have recently upgraded the CUC to 11.5.1SU6 or higher version , would explains why the issue appeared after the upgrade.
 
Please take a look to the following documentation:
 
   https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/connection/11x/security/b_11xcucsecx/b_11xcucsecx_chapter_01011.html
 
You can safely ignore the alert if you're not using encryption on your unity connection cluster (as secure integration SCCP or SIP). There's no any bug documented about this behaviour since is it a new feature that appeared on 11.5's most recent releases and not an issue with previous versions.",Closed

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 

Calls from Jabber users towards specific IVRs are dropped by our carrier. The call is initiated by the jabber client, which sends both audio and video codecs to CUCM. However, the CUCM restricts the codecs to audio only and sends the call to the carrier. After pressing a digit (DTMF) the carrier sends a delayed offer, INVITE to the CUCM. The CUCM this time replies with both audio codecs and video codecs + video port 0. The carrier accepts the SDP and sends video port 0 in the ACK. After this, the call is dropped by the carrier.  However, our main concern is why the CUCM sends the video port to the re-INVITE although in the initial offer this is not happening. Calls below:

BU final analysis below:

We discussed with the team and see the CUCM behavior is proper and works as designed.

During mid call, when we receive offer from one leg, the region bandwidth is checked and not the location bandwidth.  Location bandwidth is not reserved unless really needed. As per the LBM design, we check for Location CAC only after we receive the capabilities from both ends. This way, the bandwidth is not blocked or wasted unnecessarily.

Elaborating on it more, Let?s assume if bandwidth is allocated during 200ok itself, and it takes a few seconds to get the other end capabilities and finally if it responds without video caps, then we are unnecessarily blocking the bandwidth for few seconds.

One more use case is, if we try to allocate the bandwidth during offer itself and if it?s not available at that point of time, then video lines will not be included at all.

The rationale behind this design is to delay the bandwidth allocation as much as possible and allocate it if and only when needed so that it?s not blocked for other calls.

During early offer, location bandwidth is checked initially itself since we are still in process of setting up the call.

Hope this clarifies customer query.

From traces:
========

After receiving ACK with SDP, we are checking the location CAC, and videoBW is not allocated for this call.

In this outage, the network error occurred to the SIP stack sending a SIP message at the same instance the ethernet port is shut for the DNS changes.  The software fix for CSCuw41476 is to re-open the port after the 1 minute timer.  This fix did not resolve this issue because when the system tried to re-open the port after the 1 minute timer, the re-open also failed.  This leaves the system with the same symptoms as CSCuw41476.  The re-open appears to fail because a 2nd DNS change is occurring at this same time.  I would describe this as a double failure condition.

Please make sure the script that does the DNS changes waits at least 2 minutes between changes to allow the fix for CSCuw41476 to recover the UDP port.
 CSCvj52834 is an enhancement request which suggests not closing the port at all after a send failure.  This enhancements also suggests using TCP as a workaround to avoid the hitting the root cause for CSCuw41476.",Closed

I was at a customer site this week, and they raised a 'fault' with how Cisco Jabber currently appears to work.

When they set up an adhoc conference call within Jabber (with for example 4 people connected), there is no option to screen share to all users.

I've fully investigated this myself, and believe that it is simply not possible to do (i.e. it's not a feature that is available based on the design of Jabber) - but I wanted to get your official response.

Could you confirm if this is actually possible?

A few weeks ago I noticed that the HCMF 11.5.4 did not generated any SI files anymore (no scheduled, and no ondemand SI reports). 

Therefor I have done the following steps first to try to solve the issue:
- Restart SI service via CLI (service was running, but restarted it anyway and tried a new ondemand report, still failing)
- Reboot the HCMF server (ondemand reports still failing after that)
- Upgrade HCMF server to latest 11.5.5ES1 version (encountered a problem that no switch version was possible)
- Rebuild complete HCMF 11.5.4 server, restored backup, and upgraded successful to 11.5.5ES1

So the HCMF is now up&running with 11.5.5ES1 (11.5.5.11001-1) version.

Unfortunately in 11.5.5ES1 the SI files are still not generated properly.
For the 9.2.2 report type the file is generated (I can see on the STFP server and in the backup folder), but the jobs is still failing after a long time (> 2h, as this is my Acceptance HCMF lab, there's is not much data and an ondemand SI file should be generated in <30min normally)
For the 10.6.3 report type the job does not generate any SI files at all, and the job fails after a long time (>2h)

I have checked that all services are up&running.
Attached some screenshots.

  3.  Disable multiparty licensing for TelePresence Servers

a) We are changing IP address for EM Phone service currently Publisher IP address - from IP Address to FQDN with FQDN returning Sub 1 and Sub 2 IP address.  This is to provide redundancy To test redundancy is it fine to stop Call Manager and EM service on S1 and see EM login prevails? This is the way we tested in a test cluster and it seem to work. 
b) When S1 has Call Manager and EM service stooped is there any SQL query or visual indication that phones are using FQDN and using S2 for service
b1) How long does it take for S1 to S2 failover when we have large number of devices on a subscriber like 5000 - how many minutes it takes?

a) We are changing IP address for EM Phone service currently Publisher IP address - from IP Address to FQDN with FQDN returning Sub 1 and Sub 2 IP address.  
This is to provide redundancy To test redundancy is it fine to stop Call Manager and EM service on S1 and see EM login prevails? 
This is the way we tested in a test cluster and it seem to work. 

Answer/ It is OK to stop CUCM service as long as other registered phones are not been affected

b) When Sub1 has Call Manager and EM service stooped is there any SQL query or visual indication that phones are using FQDN and using S2 for service
Answer/ there is not SQL query but you can use the RTMT tool to check how many phones are registered to each SUB in the cluster.

b1) How long does it take for S1 to S2 failover when we have large number of devices on a subscriber like 5000 - how many minutes it takes? 
Answer/ The time is deterine by few factors, how many registration request the TFTP server will handle at same time and how quick the network is for the phones to reach the CUCM cluster.

c) Unrelated to EM redundancy topic we have the need to change the name of the phone service. 
If I change the service name and do update subscription the cucm 11.5 does not update it on the phones and UDPs. 
For example if I change the name Extension Mobility Local to Extension Mobility 7937/40/60 and click update subscriptions the phones and UDPs retain the old phone Extension Mobility. 
Do you know if this is a bug or is there a way to correct it? 
Answer/ for that kind of change you need to recreate the phone service and re-subscribe the phones to the service.

d) If I delete the EM Phone service I tested to find it gets de-subscribed then if I re-subscribe with the correct name it works - is this procedure OK 
Answer/ that is correct, it is the right procedure.

e) We have the need all UDPs with 2 services (Extension Mobility for EMCC for newer phones and EM for old phones 7937/40/60) in that correct order. 
We have a mix of UDPs with no service, one service, incorrect name etc. Is the best approach delete the service and create a udp template with 2 services (with correct name and correct order) and resubscribe?

Answer/ that is correct way to do it.",Closed

I was recently at a customer site, and they reported that they are unhappy with the difference in call quality between the following two scenarios:

1) A call between Cisco Jabber soft phone and another Cisco Jabber soft phone (i.e. '1 to 1' or 'point to point')
2) A call between Cisco Jabber soft phone, Cisco Jabber soft phone, and a mobile phone user

I've personally tested this, and it is clear that the call quality / codec between points 1) and 2) above is completely different - however I'd like to be able to make them the same (if possible).

I believe that since point 2) will require a SIP trunk, the device pool / region on the SIP trunk will force the call quality to be lower than the scenario in point 1).

Could you confirm how I can make the quality the same for both scenarios please?

========================================================================================================================================================== 
The first thing that I noticed is that the phone is asking for the CTL,ITL & Config files to the 10.60.91.3, however, it replied with 404 not found to all of the request:

?	Is this CUCM server running TFTP server? 
?	Is the ATA MAC address configured correctly in CUCM? 
========================================================================================================================================================== 

 

========================================================================================================================================================== 
Then, even though the server didn?t provide any file, the phone sends several  REGISTER messages to the same 10.60.91.3 server:

This is because the fact that each port has different MAC, therefore, the ATA requests a set of configuration files for each port, and since the port 2 is enabled by default it is expected that it will ask for both at any time.

?	The port  2, if not configured, will generate a auto-reg type of registration, while the port 1 is a normal registration message
?	If port 2 is not configured, CCM will reply as 404 Not found

And as you can see in the image below, CUCM is sending a 404 not found after a few tries to the Auto-reg SIP Register message with the following warning: ? Unable to find device/user in database? :

Resolution:
*****************************

As you can see the behavior is the same in both observation points (CUCM TRACES & Packet capture). Therefore, I would like to try the following: 

?	After further research I found the good practice for ATA190 and ATA191 is to disable the port 2 if not being used.
?	 The documentation does not make any explicit indication about it, however, it looks like the constant registration attempts being unsuccessful forces the device to maintain a regular activity downloading the configuration files for the port 2 and attempt to register over and over again and this seems to impact performance in the device causing irregular registration status on the port 1, therefore the recommendation to disable the port if not being used.",Closed

Defect: CSCub07733, Update CMR records for calls from sip trunks
 https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub07733/?reffering_site=dumpcr

Symptom:
Update CMR records for calls from sip endpoints & sip trunks

Conditions:
Currently there are no CMR records generated when calls are made from sip endpoints or when calls pass through a sip trunk, raising this product enhancement request so that we can get support for this feature.

Workaround:
NA

Further Problem Description:
Newer phone SIP FWs can provide call statistics but there will be no CMR / call statistics from a SIP Trunk.

When the SIP GW supports it, the SIP GW / PSTN can send RTP statistics when sending the BYE message, but since the SIP trunk destination may or may not generate these, this feature, (CMR records), was not extended to SIP Trunks.

In case the SIP Trunk destination supports RTP statistics, you should see on the BYE message something like:

CSeq: 102 BYE
Reason: Q.850;cause=16
Max-Forwards: 68
P-RTP-Stat: PS=294,OS=47040,PR=308,OR=48344,PL=0,JI=0,LA=0,DU=6
Content-Length: 0

## Below devices support CMR.

Please check out the following white paper:

Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance and Analytics: Grade VoIP Calls using SCSR Instead of MOS White Paper
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/prime-collaboration/white-paper-c11-735409.html


""For phones that do not generate CMR, such as Cisco TelePresence(r) TC, CE, CTX, and IX endpoints; Jabber(r) platforms (all platforms); Cisco IP Communicator; and Cisco Unified Personal Communicator, grading will be ""N/A"".""


So basically, telepresence endpoints do not support call management record in CUCM and doesn't send call statistics to CUCM.

The highlighted texts mentioned above clearly tells us that there was some network issue because of which Primary IMnP host lost DB connectivity, thus bringing SRM service down on that particular node.

I have verified the logs and provided bug details and those are partially matching and hence we are not hitting a bug.
 
Also the current firmware you are running is already having a resolution of this bug.
 
The java error is not with response code of HTTP error message which can gives us more idea. The DNS lookup is cancelled and further entries are error related with the corporate directories related with EMCC.
 
I have gone through similar cases and observed that it has been resolved due to multiple DNS entries of PUB, or reverse DNS entries are not avail,
DHCP config and due to other network parameters. From console logs it only observed that initially phone did not get any CUCM server later on might after changing the URLs in CUCM it received the add.
 
If any phone is currently in the status of unreg, its been helpful to collect packet capture from phone and cucm, SDL logs to understand better.

Then it tries to allocate a MTP for such call:

Unfortunately, there is no support for SRTP in UCCX in any current version. The last information we have from our developers in 2019 is that SRTP support on UCCX CTI Ports is being evaluated for inclusion in 12.5. So, it?s on the radar and may be coming as early as 12.5 when it releases, but at this time there?s no guarantee that it will be included in that version.

If phone is registered to CUCM, using secure configuration and working, it will work fine with UCCX

UCCX does not support the CTI ports used by CUCM to make CTI secure, that is the only thing and if call arrives to phone, security icon is not displayed as it will appear when both devices are using security.

Issue:  CUIC 12.0 Reports to ECE 12.0 Chat and Email Not working

Root Cause: User's NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT and NT Service\MSSQLSERVER on which SQL Server services are running were not added to the local group policy of the server in process level token on Reports DB.

Workaround: NA

Resolution: We've verified below checks -

1. Could see reports job is executing successfully. However, we don't see any data is populating in Reports DB.
2. Also, there are no any errors in EGMNT_ERRORS table.
3. On verifying the necessary permissions required for user NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT and NT Service\MSSQLSERVER on which SQL Server Agent service is running we don't see both the user's are added to local group policy of the server in process level token. The application uses the functionality provided by the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to allow customdata to be available for inclusion in custom reports. Note that custom data is not available in the reports that are included out-of-the-box.
4. Checked the status of the SSIS package (EG_DATA_COPY.dtsx) and were stuck in pending state.

To resolve the issue, we've performed below actions on AD Server and Reports DB -

1. Added both the users NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT and NT Service\MSSQLSERVER  to local group policy of the server in process level token by following steps shared in our previous email.
2. Rebooted Database server to bring in above changes in effect.
3. Executed report job
4. Verified status of the SSIS package (EG_DATA_COPY.dtsx) by running the execution report and could see status of the package was succeeded.

After performing above actions, we could see data is populated in Reports DB successfully. We've tested by running the test reports from ECE reports console and from CUIC console as well and could see data is available in the reports.",Closed

On last Friday and Saturday due to network issue Perth UC applications were isolated, they were not reachable from customer site as well as from Melbourne DC. During this time Jabber login from corporate network as well via expressway did not work. 

For MRA, Melbourne expressway E is primary which was accessible during the network issue, still login did not worked.
 

Surprisingly, For these Jabber devices Melbourne CUCM nodes are primary but still they were not able to login. Just that on UC service profile I can see Perth IMP node is primary but secondary node is configured as Melbourne IMP node, so ideally failover should have worked.

From RTMT logs, looks like issue was triggered at Jan 10 at 17:15 when Melbourne CUCM and IMP node lost connection on Perth Publisher.  I am attaching logs from Jan 10 17:00 to Jan 11 00:00 hours. Please help to identify the root cause why failover did not work. Sample User ID - bushra.kabir

We are unable to fix the issue with the advertised pilot number 85666. To get around it, we applied below workaround:
?	Creating a new hunt group with new pilot number 83056 and verify call routing being successful with this pilot number

 

?	Modify below translation pattern so that called number 85666 gets translated to 83056, then call is distributed to line group members.

This resolved the issue.

Issue 2: When retrieving the voicemails, the prompt would say incorrect username ?message from called party username instead of calling username?
Sol: ** On sip trunk to CUC, the caller ID was first redirecting number.Due to this CUC saw the call was From user Rizwanand also the VM was for rizwan.

We have an user from our customer Allianz that is experincing problems with calls, both at Jabber PC and hardphone. The issue is that sometimes he receives calls from PSTN and sometimes not. When he doesn't receive a call, we haven't a CDR.

We have 2 wireshark traces from PSTN provider, with a call ok, and another one with a failed call. In this case, they receive a 404 from our call manager CUST04-CUCM-CL1-S03.intrallianz.es with IP 
The affected user is 'calljbx' with line +34915960261, he registers at CUCM with IP 213.140.45.36

At wireshark traces you can see that when call works fine, it arrives at IP 213.140.45.35 what belongs to CUST04-CUCM-CL1-S01.intrallianz.es, on the other hand, when call fails, the 404 comes from CUST04-CUCM-CL1-S04.intrallianz.es with IP 94.142.113.147

Attached are the 2 wireshark traces.

I remember there was some defects in the past with old version og Jabber Mac / Jabber guest related to encoding.",Jabber for iPhone login failure.,KDDI EUROPE LTD,Voice - Communications Manager Additional Apps and Plugins,Jabber (Mobile Devices) - User Login,Documentation Provided,10.6.1,"1) For original error - Requested CUCM side logs + configuration to investigate further. 
Looks like user is able to login now, so issue is not reproducible.

2) There was another issue connecting to Voicemail server, which was due to Firewall. 
3) There was also Certificate Not Valid prompt upon each sign in. Cert was Imagicle used for contact search, worked on correcting that cert.
3) One more query customer raised: 
 Why jabber generating and picking up DefaultUser ?

Though it's irrelevant to the issue and this email is not used to construct JID, customer is still curious. 
Found that it's used with EMM feature for mobile to push userid so that user doesn't have to enter it each time: 
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/jabber/12_5/DIG_OnPrem/cjab_b_on-premises-deployment-cisco-jabber_125/cjab_b_on-premises-deployment-cisco-jabber_125_chapter_010000.html#CJAB_RF_M2B66F7A_00 

But there's nothing about Jabber populating this field with defaultuser@domain. Only found such behaviour for Jabber 4 windows with no UPN CSCuy69812 
Got response from BU:

?This default user is just used as the placeholder when UPN discovery is disabled. It is put into the ?last loaded? profile just so it is displayed as the default for the initial login. Once they login with any other ID, the last loaded profile will be changed.
It provides a default entry so the value isn?t empty, and shows what syntax is expected when you first enter a new value.?

So it?s there for initial login so value is not empty, that?s the use case for both mobile and Windows platforms.

4) Another query was related to certificate-based authentication for Jabber

So far they?ve identified a workaround of running a recovery CD on the affected Sub with ?F? option for a file system check/recovery. Afterwards Subscriber booted successfully to 11.5 version.

++ As a workaround, we disconnected CUCM Subscriber from the network and you also stopped Side B PG.

For our customer Rentokil we have encountered and issue where calls are hitting the wrong PQ, which seems to be caused by the ICM scripts using variables to get the PQ name together. When a call hits a script the script elements will use variables to finally get to the correct PQ name, which is then used as a variable with PQ select node.

It is as if the script uses information from a non related call to fill the variables, which should not be possible. Due to the variables being used in the script being incorrect for the handling of the specific call the call ends up on wrong agent. Think like an English inbound number variable get set as a Spain inbound number variable and hence the English call ending up at a Spanish speaking agent.

Our delivery engineer is currently working the clock round to get a workaround in place. We are only seeing this issue at the 11.6.2 ES7 release at the moment. We have a lot of other customers out there with similar script setup but on a different UCCE version where issue is not observed (UCCE 11.5.1 X and lower).

We do not have any UCCE 12.X customers yet, so we are not sure if the 12.X release train has this issue as well.

I still need to collect logs for this, so if you can let me know which logs are needed, please let me know. I was thinking script example file and rtr logs, but maybe I am missing something.

Customer performing UAT is receiving *live* calls.
Calls coming in to the Eradico scripts (in which everything has the prefix ERA), despite not leaving that script (which is isolated), are sporadically ending up with WES or PAC prefixes.
These prefixes never appear in the Eradico scripts ? it?s impossible for them to end up like this under normal circumstances

Also, from the SQL screenshot, you can see that the dynamic naming of the PQ changes (PeripheralVariable3) before it gets to the ?Send to PQ? node in the script

I altered the script again yesterday, and reinstated the old dynamic creation process alongside the hard-coded version.
Now we sometimes see this;

 


PeripheralVariable3 is the active version, much of which is hard-coded.
PeripheralVariable6 is the ?redundant? version, using the original, more dynamic logic.

INC.,"Voice - Phones, Fax, Modems",IP Phone with Communications Manager (except wireless),Software Configuration,10.6.1,"I found out that this will be expected behavior on 12.6.1 Firmware and later:

Revert to Primary Line in Session Line Mode
When a user is set up for Session line mode, the phone always uses the primary line for outgoing calls unless the user selects another line. If the user has calls on multiple lines, the calls are handled in sequence. When the last call ends, the phone reverts to the primary line.
You don't need to enable Revert to All Calls and Show All Calls on Primary Line for reversion to work.

Field: Always Use Prime Line

This field specifies whether the primary line on an IP phone is chosen when a user goes off-hook. If this parameter is set to True, when a phone goes off-hook, the primary line is chosen and becomes the active line. Even if a call rings on the second line of the user, when the phone goes off-hook, it makes only the first line active. It does not answer the inbound call on the second line. In this case, the user must choose the second line to answer the call. The default value is set to False.

The purpose of the Always Use Prime Line field is very similar to the combination of Show All Calls on the Primary Line and Revert to All Calls when both of those two features are enabled. However, the main difference is that when Always Use Prime Line is enabled, inbound calls are not answered on the second line. Only dial tone is heard on the prime line. There are certain high call volume environments where this is the desired user experience. In general, it is best to leave this field disabled except for high call volume environments that require this feature.

And CU had restarted the system at around 12.00 time.

After the restart , we no longer seeing the issue related to Outofmemory or UnreachableDestination table.

To prevent outofmemory on native thread

  1.  We need to add XX:PermSize equal to -XX:MaxPermSize . This will prevent the call server to go outofmemory and do proper clean up permgen memory .


Step 1. Open the Regedit and navigate to the location Wow6432Node -> Apache Software Foundation -> Procrun 2.0 -> CallServer -> Parameters -> Java -> Options.
Step 2. Double click over Options or right click over Options and press modify.
Step 3. Append these values data box:

     -XX:PermSize=128m
     -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

Hi Josue,
Here is what was gather from the logs collected:


  1.  The logs even they have some information, no debug were set for the HSRP so we can also guess that the connection cause the router to failover.
  2.  The configuration of the HSRP had a wrong entry as you guys suspected

Per documentation please check if the amount of dial-peer you have configured are supported by the amount of memory installed in the GW.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/voice/call-routing-dial-plans/14074-in-dial-peer-match.html

Note: The maximum number of dial peers that can be configured on a Cisco IOS gateway depends on the available memory (DRAM). Each dial peer consumes approximately 6KB of memory. Make sure that you have at least 20% of the total memory reserved for other CPU processes. If the dial peers are used for call routing, a larger number of dial peers will add to the delay to route a call. This will be significant as the Cisco IOS voice stack looks through dial peers from the top down, similar to an Access Control List.

Please let me know if you have any questions?

We have issues with a Cisco 7821 device. It remains in Unknown Registration state.
We received confirmation from the customer that the port and cabling are ok, factory reset was performed, the phone is getting IP address from the voice VLAN (172.31.4.53 ), but it shows ""No active server registered"". We have also seen the phone requesting for the config file also the server responding to its request..

Platform: EMEA: 
FAULT DETAILS
BT fault reference number: n/a
Business Impact: User access and other issues
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Anglo American had a security breach last year, consequently all the passwords are non-standard.
We have found that any new CUCM users have a couple of access issues:
	Unable to download SDL logs from RTMT
	Unable to log into IMP publisher

We understand the cause of the issue is because the CUCM > IMP Cisco Agent Sync is not operating.
but we are unable to start the IMP Cisco Agent Sync

There are also some warnings on IMP publisher:

1. Copy the jre folder (inside the zip) to a known location on the Unified CVP Server. For example, C:\JRE.
2. Unzip JREUpdate.zip contents to a known location on your CVP Server. For example, C:\Cisco\CVP\bin. (this .zip should be inside your Cisco/CVP/bin folder).
3. To update the JRE version on the Unified CVP Server, run this script from the command prompt:
C:\Cisco\CVP\bin >JREUpdate.bat apply C:\JRE
4. The script executes and the CVP JRE gets updated to the new version. Ensure that the script output displays the updated JRE version.
5. The JREUpdate.bat script takes a backup of the old JRE on C:\Cisco\CVP\jre.old folder location. To revert to the previous backup version of JRE run this script from the command prompt:
C:\Cisco\CVP\bin>JREUpdate.bat revert

  *   We checked network connectivity towards the session targets 10.120.95.165 and 10.120.95.200 respectively from CUCM using ping and found that there were multiple packet drops (50 to 55% packet loss). This suggests that there is some network issue.
  *   Furthermore, we collected packet captures from CUCM to check the why the trunks are in down state. After checking the packet captures, we found that when the network is stable, CUCM is not receiving any reply to the OPTIONS keepalive message sent to the required destination IPs, thereby marking the trunk as down.
  *   All incoming and outgoing calls routed via the affected trunks are getting dropped by CUCM by 503 Service Unavailable error response.

Network connectivity was fixed and after that the SIP trunks were up.",Closed

The CUCM IP address is 10.253.23.1 and SBC IP address is 10.253.23.234.  From the packet capture, I saw TLS handshaking and SBC sent a RST at the end.  Because CUCM has signed CallManager and CallManager-EDCSA certificates, I was not sure which one it sent for key exchange but it should be CallManager certificate.  After you review it and find that there is an issue on the SBC, I will open a ticket to the vendor.

The only two methods to solve it are:
Make all SRTP for CUCM, i.e., use only secure phones.
Make the far end to support the fallback, so CUCM continues with RTP only (in this case the CUBE-SP you mentioned).
 
In that way, you will need to ask to your CUBE-SP third party, to enable SRTP fallback/interoperability/negotiation, so they can manage it.

At times, need arises when there is insufficient space in the Logging Partition and additional space needs to be created for certain activity in call manager to take place. During such events additional space could be created in the Logging Partition, adjusting the threshold values of High WaterMark and LowWaterMark repectively.

Hi Russell,
I did the research for any defects on HCM-F 12.5.1 that match the issue you are having. I found the following document which states that the CUCDM 8.x is not compatible with HCM-F 12.5.1SU1.

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/hcs/12_5/HCS_Solution/Release_Notes/Cisco_HCS_12_5_Release_Notes.html

Cisco Unified CDM Deprecated Features

These features that are related to Cisco Unified CDM 8.x will not be available from Hosted Collaboration Solution release 12.5 and later:

    CUCDMSync functionality that provisions customer data from Cisco Unified CDM 8.x to SDR will not function.
    You must manually stop the Cisco Unified CDM sync functionality when you upgrade to HCMF 12.5 and later

    The Service Inventory reports that provide billing information based on Cisco Unified CDM 8.x cannot be generated.

    Note: If you have already generated the SI reports before upgrade, the reports remain intact. Post upgrade to HCM-F 12.5, you cannot generate the SI reports for Cisco Unified CDM 8.x.

    You cannot schedule and retrieve on-demand reports for Cisco Unified CDM 8.x application.

    You cannot add Cisco Unified CDM 8.x Management applications using the HCM-F 12.5 interface.

I hope this helps you.

we do not receive a BYE the channel is kept in a ?Call seen state?. I have two example TXT files uploaded to the case for your review. 

Recent Updates: 
We did migrate the inbound/outbound site gateways from H323 to sip. Shouldn?t really be a part of this call flow as our calls are routed and come from ACME. From there I think we use BIB to split the audio to the recording server. This should be limited to SIP communication on the trunk from UCM to Verint.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

We were finishing the CUAC upgrade from 10.5.2 to 12.04.20-14 but the CUAC Unified Attendant Server service will not start and is stuck between a ?Stopped ? service is running\server is stopped? and  ?Initializing - Server is Initializing? state,

Have tried numerous things like restarting the Pub and Sub, various services yet still not working.

Have searched Cisco.com and have seen we may of run into bug CSCva12833. Uploading a COP file is not going to be an option.

There is still 5 hours left in our PEW window so will need this looking into asap

we are using IPSMA product from TELISCA which is cisco partner. This service using for call filtering purposes. Its actually using for manager asistance services. 
IPSMA use CTI port, we have got an issue on this service yesterday 11:53am  this call filtering feature didnt work till we restarted CTI service and after all CTI ports registered back everything was fine.
I already opened case to TELISCA they analyze the logs and offer to me check CTI service status during mentioned time by Cisco TAC. 
? have already collect SDL,event logs and CTI manager logs.
could you check these logs?

you can see TELISCA answer as below:
Hello,

Thank you for the logs, you will find an extract analyzed.

There was an issue on the CUCM Subscriber (10.221.52.4) on which telisca CTI Server is connected, at 11:53:45. IP Phones and IPSMA CTI Ports got unregistered and they did not got in Service again.

This did not prevent telisca CTI Server to work:
- To push the banner on the phone
- To create calls between IPSMA CTI Port and IPSMA CTI ROute POint to light the IPSMA Filter BLF

However no CTI Event was received when filtered call was ringing the IPSMA CTI Ports, so the filtering treatment is not raised.

-> If you want to dig out the root cause you may as Cisco support to analyze what happenend on the Subscriber 10.221.52.4  at 11:53:45, and particularly on the CTI Manager.

It is possible to Monitor telisca CTI Server status using the Monitor URL (see chapter 5 of the guide attached). However in this particular case, the CTI Server was working fine but some of feature was not working because of IPSMA CTI Port status. The only solution I see should be to use a script on telisca Morning Check to test periodically the filtering on a test manager's phone (see data sheet attached)

I found 248 such CTI messages sent out to Telisca CTI server around this time, you can look through them in attached SDL file.

To summarize:
=============
There was no issue from CUCM perspective and no evidence of misbehavior ? it was sending all events for filtered call to Telisca CTI server, but didn't receive any response.
The root cause of ports unregistration ? connectivity loss between CCM/CTI services running on the server where ports are registered and Pub, to which telisca app talks.
Upon SDL link going back in service between Pub & Sub and devices registration status sync?ed, CUCM has sent DeviceInService / ProviderDeviceRegisteredWithLineInfoEvent  events to Telisca app.
Overall it was around 15 seconds of ?outage? from CUCM side (between CTI ports going out and in service).

So either IPSMA didn't get the messages or couldn't process them (JTAPI client issue or Telisca app issue).

Since there?s no JTAPI log for further investigation, please enable it next time issue occurs. Full set of logs for investigation in case issue re-occurs:
1) CUCM cluster:
  *   CTI manager
  *   CallManager
  *   RIS DC Perfmon
  *   Event viewer system/application log

The Expressways are configured identically except for IP address & certificate info that is specific to each Expressway.  The trunks to the Expressway-Cs are in a circular route group.  When placing a call from a video endpoint, calls to the first Expressway-C always result in a request terminated and the second Expressway-C handles the call.  If the call is routed to the second Expressway-C initially, it works fine.  This is particularly puzzling as the first Expressway-C/E was initially the ONLY Expressway pair in place and worked fine.  The second Expressway pair was added to the route group yesterday morning and tested OK at that time... that is calls were successfully being load balanced between the Expressway pairs.  However, yesterday afternoon the behavior with the first Expressway pair sending a 487 began, with no known configuration changes having been applied.

In this document it states that HCS 12.5 and UCCE 11.0.
Can someone please tell me what components are not supported, do they actually work but not supported etc..

Thanks in advance",need clarification surround compatibility statement,BUCHER  SUTER AG,Contact Center Software,UCCE/Contact Center Enterprise/ICM - Peripheral Gateway (PG),Customer Education,9.2.1,"So if I read your statement correctly, no HCS partner can upgrade HCS to version 12.5 without upgrading all the UCCE customer instances to V12 beforehand??? Yes, You will have to upgrade the the components beforehand.

Can you please confirm exactly what is not supported? Will UCCE version 11.0 still work with PCA 12.1 for example? If you have installed PCA 12.1 with Service pack 3 UCCE 11.x is supported. Please find the compatibility Matrix as under for PCA 12.3: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/prime/collaboration/supported_devices/PCA_12-1-sp3/Supported_Devices_for_Cisco_Prime_Collaboration_Assurance_12_1-Service-Pack-3.html

When you say not supported, what exactly is not supported. Is it just the HCS tools working with versions that Cisco will not officially support? The operation of the UCCE with HCS tools will not be supported but when it comes to the support of the actual product of UCCE that will be supported.

The information has been provided to the customer",Closed

This means that Jabber will select the CCMIP and TFTP servers via the cisco-uds servers.

There are two options to be able to use which CCMCIP Profile will be used, it would be either using _cuplogin as Service Discovery, or using manual login pointing to an IM&Presence server, by doing that jabber will read the CCMCIP server configured in the IM and Presence server, under Application > Client Settings and Application > CCMCIP Profile.

We have CUCM and Unity connection Ver(11.5.1.16086-2) which has centralize SIP trunk connection to PSTN. 

When you dial in Unity External VM access number, you hear the enter you pin prompt but the system doesn't recognize the DTMF digits.

that had a ""Native call queueing"" or another value that would ""queue"" the call (with no one available this leads to MOH).
The ""other"" possibility could be related to the ""Logged into Hunt Group"" setting at the device level.

Step 3

If the test shows an error, note the intercluster peer IP address; it should reference the cluster on which you uploaded the CA certificate(s). Continue with the following steps to resolve the issue.

Step 4

Choose Presence > Inter-Clustering and click the link associated with the intercluster peer that was identified on the System Troubleshooter page.

Step 5

Click Force Manual Sync.

Step 6

Allow 60 seconds for the Inter-cluster Peer Status panel to auto-refresh.

I found an enhancement raised for this issue which can be the root cause.

Symptom:

When generating a CTL File and using Multi-SAN certificates, it will only place 1 entry in the CTL file under CCM+TFTP for the Publisher node.
Due to this, devices that support Security by Default (ITL) will be required to reach out to TVS to verify the certificate of any node that is not the Publisher.
Devices that do not support Security by Default, will only be able to register with the Publisher node, and will fail registration with any other node.

You can refer to the bug:

 https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz76174

Action Plan:

++ 7940 and 7960 phones do not support Security by Default and you are using multisan certificates.

++Kindly try registering phones on publisher node and check once if the issue gets resolved.",Closed

The adding voice mail error ?informix.ck_tbl_alias_alias_locationobjecti?
is caused by attempting to re-add a voicemail which already exists on the
unity.

In our investigation we found that all the users provided as examples are
in the site, they had the voice mail at the parent site level, while the
subscriber is at the child site. This would break the subscribers
association to the voicemail and allow the user to add the same voicemail
again, causing this error.

It is important to understand that during new user provisioning the
voicemail must be moved down to the child site.

Unfortunately we did not have enough data to understand why these cuc
models where at the parent site. However we can run an export of cucm user
models and cuc user models on Tiffany and compare them, this will allow us
to fix any other problem users at Tiffany to avoid further errors.

Our customer allianz is checking CMR records from CUCM and they have several questions about data from them.

Attached to this case, I will upload some of this files from last week.

What they ask is the following:

#1 First of all, I see plenty of statistics metrics (columns H through Q in CMR) missing in the file. What is the reason this data is missing even for intra-cluster calls?
Example
In CMRs ALU EMEA cluster: this is direct Jabber to Jabber call which lasts 216 seconds but there are no quality stats in either direction. Even both parties (CSF8844657 and CSF8844564) are located in the same physical office so what may be the obstacle to generate this data?

#2 How can we interpret the data in respective columns ? I am trying to add/subtract specific values but that does not match at all.
ORIG_NUMBER_PACKETS_SENT
ORIG_NUMBER_PACKETS_RECEIVED
ORIG_NUMBER_PACKETS_LOST
DEST_NUMBER_PACKETS_SENT
DEST_NUMBER_PACKETS_RECEIVED
DEST_NUMBER_PACKETS_LOST

#3 ORIG_JITTER means measured for the stream coming from originating party towards destination or vice versa?

#4 Is that an average throughout the entire call so does not include bursts/peaks of jitter?

#5 ORIG_LATENCY means measured for the stream coming from originating party towards destination or vice versa?

#6 Is that an average throughout the entire call so does not include bursts/peaks


Please, could you help us with this?

All phones are using sip88xx.11-0-1-11 firmware. I just need to confirm next steps. Looking at the capture the TCP transaction sets up for TFTP but we never receive the actual requests from the phones. Need to confirm any other potential causes beyond the client's network.

they tried to do backup and that did not go well so the TAc engineer said
need to rebuild the PUB
that is how they got to requeue
the people working with me thought that the original PUB was deleted from the VM host
but the just few minutes ago another engineer from partner join
the webex and he said that the PUB still exist
that was just off
so we turn on and try to backup again
and the issue was that the SFTP server did not have disk space so it was failing
and also the IPSec cert was expired
so the combination of the two was making the backup to be imposible

so we are all happy because the backup is working now",Closed

*   We successfully uploaded tomcat multi-san cert on the CUCM cluster. We reloaded the nodes and once they came up, we checked that the certs are evenly distributed to all nodes and tomcat-trust as well. All the  phones got registered successfully as well.
  *   We disabled IMnP HA on CUCM and successfully uploaded the cup-xmpp cert on both the IMnP nodes. We reloaded the nodes and later confirmed that the required cert is under cup-xmpp-trust as well. We forgot to enable IMnP HA on CUCM. Please do so.
  *   We tried uploading CUC certs but we faced the mentioned error: ?CSR public key and Certificate public key do not match?. After investigating further, we found that that the CSR used to generate the certificate is old and is not matching with the current CSR available on CUC.
*   I advised you to use this new CSR (Downloaded from CUC PUB) to generate the certs from CA authority, upload it to CUC pub and sub, reload the nodes one by one and check the uploaded certs?s expiry date.
*   You informed that you have received the new cert from the customer. We uploaded this cert to CUC Pub and as it was Multi-SAN cert, this cert was installed on CUC Sub as well.
  *   We restarted the CUC Pub and Sub so the certificate install takes effect.
  *   We compared the old certs?s Public Key with new cert?s Public key and we could see the difference. That is the reason that we were facing cert upload failure earlier.
  *   Now the certs are successfully installed and everything is working as expected.",Closed

This is at the beginning of the loop so the SIPHandler thread is not backed up yet.  Notice the three destination ip addresses associated with this trunk:

Here it goes out on the wire to 10.24.8.32:

So the loop is happening on several nodes for MWI and it all has to do with routelist AON_SAPAC_CUCM_RL  and SIP trunk AON_CUCM_SAPAC_SIP_Trunk.

This configuration problem is what caused all the cores.

CU never replied back after receiving the analysis from the dev team.

Now it is not clear if this patching could impact the CUIC PUB alone as we have Subscriber in Denver too that was not impacted. So there are 4 CUIC servers PUB and Sub1 in Denver and Sub2 and 3 in Austin and none of the SUB's were impacted. If this was due to the patching on HDS that might have triggered the CUIC side, we will need the events in the logs that will show us the reason.

It looks like we are hitting this following bug:

 https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuw78377

------------------------

You are on 10.5.2.10000-5 which is in the affected train and this is resolved in 10.5.2SU9. Please check the resolved caveats section in the below read me file for more information :

    https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/sustaining/cucm_b_readme-1052su9.pdf

-------------------------

This case was raised for coredumps for which we have shared the analysis and the resolution is to upgrade. Further shared the below details. 

If you need any assistance regarding upgrade then I will suggest raising separate ticket for simplicity and we can probably reference this ticket in the new ticket for upgrade concerns, Let me know.


Please find below my inputs:

++ Can we upgrade CUCM to System version: 11.5.1.16086-2 (version we are upgrading to) and  whether it is compatible with Cisco Unified CCX Administration - System version: 10.6.1.10000-39 (current SERCO?s UCCX).

  *   CUCM 11.5.1.16086-2 has been deferred due to CSCvm87093, You might want to consider newer ES for CUCM on 11.5.
  *   CUCM 11.5 SU?s are compatible with UCCX 10.6 ? However please check the HCS compatibility matrix based on the HCS version.
  *   UCCX 10.6 Compatibility Matrix.

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/crs/express_compatibility/matrix/uccxcompat10_6_1.html

++ Is there any impact to the end user/agent experience if we don?t update CCX and CAD working with CUCM 11.5?
  *   There shouldn?t be any noticeable impact, However please be aware CAD has been end of support. End of support since July 31 2018.

 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/customer-collaboration/unified-contact-center-enterprise/eos-eol-notice-c51-733718.html


++ For defect : CSCuw78377, You can upgrade to to CUCM 10.5.2SU9

  *   If the above option don?t work, we may need to consider a patch upgrade to fix the current bug/problem.
  *   Hence Please provide the patch so that we can check with our REs.",Closed

I have attached PRT logs on the case.
Kindly assist with this issue.",Jabber for iPhone getting logged out automatically,ORANGE BUSINESS SERVICES SCEF,Voice - Communications Manager Additional Apps and Plugins,Jabber (Mobile Devices) - User Login,Software Configuration,10.6.1,"As per the discussion with the BU engineer, this is expected and it should get fixed with the APNS deployment.
For doing so we will need to follow this document:

 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/push_notifications/cucm_b_push-notifications-deployment-guide.pdf

Alongside the proper versions needed.
Other than that we don't have any further workaround for the issue with the current versions that the customer has, they will need to upgrade to the recommended versions in the documentation.


After keeping investigating the latest PRT shared by Atul we find something really interesting. That matched the behavior you were saying and that you couldn?t reproduce in your lab.
The iPhone asking for the user to press the login button. During the past few days Colin and I were working on this to actually go through the very bottom of the situation and we have find the following:

The issue we are seeing on that iPhone It?s related to Local Authentication TouchID feature for iPhone.

What we are seeing is that the end user enabled TouchID, but authentication failed and get_edge_request got 401 error several times while login Jabber due to invalid credentials, so local authentication was treated as authenticate required (fast login disabled) and show sign-in screen while press Jabber icon.


There are two cases with Touch ID enabled
1. If authenticate failed due to invalid credentials, need to reauthenticate again while kill and relaunch Jabber.
2. If the customer do sign out and sign in Jabber manually, it needs to reauthenticate again.

So in order to configure it correctly you?ll need to do the following
1. input correct credentials in Jabber during login while enable Touch ID.
2. Do reauthenticate while press Jabber icon, and kill and relaunch again, it should work fine.

Or to have a quick fix you could disable Touch ID with the XML config key LocalAuthenticationWithBiometrics if you don?t want to go with the previously described behavior.


However we still recommend that the APNS needs to be deployed since we don?t know when Apple will decommission the Voice Sockets, and that will definitely impact your deployment, since that change can come at any given time and directly from Apple company. That?s why APNS is strongly recommended as best practice.",Closed

Solution:

++ As per you there was a change made yesterday afternoon.
++ I pulled the audit logs but I can?t see any reference from yesterday. Probably the logs have been overwritten.

I researched this and found this article that clearly sets guidelines for recommending Thick provisioning, but alludes to the option that Think provisioning can be supported, but disk space MUST be maintained in the array.

++ The issue is due to the two RDS datastores on the UCCX servers being out of sync while ?Document Upload? is performed in the script.

++ Usually when upload step is executed in the script the RDS datastore goes out of sync for milliseconds and comes back in sync once the file is pushed on both nodes.

++ Verified below file was modified on the same date and time on both CCX nodes.

See the latest from VOSS:


Grant Wilson took a look at the bug that Therodus raised and provided the following response:

The problem here is that the left model in the relation which is, HcsAdminUserDat, gets created correctly with space in the username. Eg: ""User Test""
But the right model which is data/User gets created with the invalid space character replaced by an Underscore eg: ""User_Test"". The data/User model is where all of the Users details are stored which is why this appears blank as there is now no link between the left model and the right model as the join is done on the Username which no longer matches.

When the right model is created its using the following CFT in the workflow steps below:

Step 7 - Template (HcsAddUserCFT) before evaluation:
{
""username"": ""{{ fn.replace input.hcsUname, ,_ }}"",



Step 7 - Template (HcsAddUserCFT) after evaluation:
{
""username"": ""User_Test"",



In my opinion space should never be used in a Username and we should block input of this via a Regex in the Relation GUI rule as well as backend validation in the Data model in data/HcsAdminUserDat


For the time being ....

In the short term to fix this problem, VOSS can login with tdkadmin and modify the data/User model instances directly and add back the required space which has been replaced by the Underscores. Or alternatively modify the data/HcsAdminUserDat and replace the space with an Underscore.
               .
               .
               .

               VOSS L3 input:


Even though we can perform a workaround for the existing admins who have spaces, I would rather suggest deleting those and recreating them with no spaces.  As I mentioned on the troubleshooting call and per our developer, there should be no spaces when creating usernames.

I am trying to confirm if Regex will be adjusted to block the ability to create user names with spaces. Looking at the bug, it looks like spaces will not be allowed in our next release 20.1.1.

We should try to get out of this habit now because of this.

Let me know your thoughts. We can get on and take care of existing admins if there are issues with deleting/recreating but it should be pretty straightforward.


In short, we can either modify the Local Admins currently created, or delete and recreate these admins without spaces due to this will not be allowed in future releases anyways.",Closed w/o Customer Confirm

When a PSTN  call comes in the system and hit the Auto Attendant, if the caller tries to get transfered, they will not ear ring back during the transfer. 

Call flow : PSTN PRI (581-824-0372) -> GTW SIP -> CUCM -> CUC -> can ear CUC -> REFER 3358 -> NO RING BACK -> AFTER 18 sec -> CUC VM Can ear

After looking at the trace, I see that CUCM request for an Annonciator but never sends the udp port to the GTW. Insteed I see that the CUCM sends to the GTW a m=audio 4000.

With a network capture to the GTW, I can confirm that the GTW receives the ringback on the correct port. It can just no be eared over the call.

I have found bug id CSCvc12634 wich mention a simillar scenario. It states that the workaround is using a late offer trunk for refered calls, but in this scenario, cucm already sends the INVITE late offer. It respons to the 200OK w/SDP of the GTW with an ACK that contains m=audio 4000.

Common call flow is:
 PSTN > CUBE > WAN/MPLS > VG2xx
Call Manager version is 11.5.1.15900-18
Here are some questions and answers:
1.	Since when is the issue being faced? Any recent change? New implementation? 
Hard to say, sporadic VG2xx are being affected
2.	Is the fax failing for all kind of calls? (inbound, outbound, different clusters, etc) 
only inbound to faxes. Might be inbound codec related
3.	Which is the exact behavior you are facing? 
Faxes ring but do not go through inbound only
4.	Around how many devices are being affected? 
Multiple locations
5.	Which is the complete call flow including protocols? 
  PSTN > CUBE (SIP) > MPLS > VG2xx (SIP)
6.	Which fax protocol are you using? T.38
7.	Show tech of the VGs I need to get the next one that complains.

This happens any time the server is powered down by means other than through the GUI, the CLI command ""utils system shutdown"" or using the vSphere Guest Shutdown feature.

Possible symptoms: After an ungraceful shutdown, the system becomes subceptible to file corruption and may lead to several inconsistent and unexpected behaviours.

Troubleshooting: If the system is suspect of being corrupt after performing the initial pertinent troubleshooting, then you may run the recovery disk as explained here

Closely monitor the system and inform the customer that in the event the system continues to show unexpected behaviour they need to rebuild as per CSCth53322 and CSCth60800.

I noticed first that the backup is not working again, I tried restarting it, but no luck. 
I then performed the DB vacuum, I made sure there's a snapshot taken. It was completed successfully but I got the same error, connection refused. I tried restarting the whole server several times but to no avail. 
I reverted to the snapshot to remove the DB vacuum in the equation (maybe suspected of causing the issue). 
I checked further by reviewing the alarm notifications (e-mail), I found that it stopped last 22-Jan 2020. 

I'd like to ask assistance in resolving our issue.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Ravi is aware of issue and has advised raising TAC case.
Questions for TAC:

The XMPP CSR generated was a multi-server SAN CSR , Does this mean the signed XMPP cert will need to be loaded on just the IMP Publisher and it should replicate on the Subscriber ?

The customer has provided us with the intermediate and root CA. However , looking at the certs , the XMPP-Trust certs that are loaded on the cluster show as ""imported from inter-cluster peer hcs-jab-impw116.jabil.com"". I am assuming the same intermediate and root CA were used on Cluster 116. So does this mean the Intermediate and root CA certs from Cluster116 were manually uploaded on Cluster 203 ? If so, will this need to be carried out again and do we not need to upload the intermediate and root CAs directly as XMPP-Trust on Cluster 203 ?

The Tomcat Certs on the servers are also going to expire soon and we have sent a CSR to get the cert signed ? Assuming the customer uses the same CA to sign this certificate as they did for XMPP , I believe we can use the same intermediate and root CA certs that we uploaded as cup-xmpp-trust , but this time upload them as tomcat-trust . Is this correct ?

As CU is moving configuration from old system to new one, calls through UCCE cluster are working correctly, however, from HCS cluster, they are not.

HCS/CUCM<>CUBE<>Provider, all SIP

Initially, we  started troubleshooting the outbound calls.

We verified the call was matching the incorrect dial-peers.

we were matching dial-peer 200 as incoming from CUCM and 103 as outgoing to provider.

Taking care of them, the 200 was not the correct one from CUCM, it should be matching 101 or 109.

We modified dial-peers in order to match via URI.

We tested and it was not working yet.

We verified, and found we are sending audio, video and app capabilities, which could be possibly causing an issue with provider side.


Focusing, on calls with dead air, we were going to verify the statistics, as it seems the jabber we are using is not being reached fro the correct interface.

After it, CU complained, all site was down.

***Problem 2, incoming calls stared to fail.


With TS, provider stated we were creating a loop, we verified, and it was matched dial-peer for outgoing side, instead of CUCM, to provider again. We changed destination pattern from some dial-peers, and calls are working now.

***Coming back to outbound calls, we will force audio only.


We are currently using dial-peer 102, as outgoing to provider and 109 as incoming from CUCM.


After:

voice service voip
sip
audio forced


Calls are still facing no audio. We verified and jabber seems to be not reachable through correct interface. CU is using VPN


CU tested from deskphones, and calls are working.

Now, they are working on extension to extension calls.


We are currently in a webex session troubleshooting calls from to webex:

Calling number: 7006
Called number: 1-868-224-2249


We are matching incorrect dial-peer, incoming 109 and outgoing 103. We should match 101 as incoming, in order to use GiEth0/0/1.45 interface for media.
We did a matching via URI for 101.

We tested and it seems to be intermittent yet. Current call example:

My thinking is that CUIC does not load all of the report until you scroll down and so Chrome would not find it.

We have experience an issue when we are trying to add a SFTP server for the BACK-UP of Cisco Call Manager.

We have lost the config for the initial SFTP server which was used for the CUCM to send backup files and we were forced to do a rebuild for SFTP Server. Now, all the connectivity are in place, but CUCM is rejecting the connection with below error:

admin:utils disaster_recovery device add network ESMAD7BR04_new /cust89/cucm 10.108.8.50 cust89 1
Please enter password to connect to network server 10.108.8.50:**********
drfCliMsg: Unable to save Backup Device successfully. Update failed : Unable to access SFTP server. Please ensure the given path is correct.

Executed command unsuccessfully

We have checked all the path and everything seems fine at the permissions and connectivity level, more than that, we are able to connect on the SFTP server with the same credentials using different other tools like WinSCP or even SSH or Telnet, so SFTP looks fine, the only problem is that the CUCM is not accepting this connection.

Would you be so kind to send us a meeting invite and help us checking what else did we missed?

AWDB Failover
The prerequisites for AWDB failover are as follows:


The secondary Administrative Workstation Database (AWDB) is configured.
The secondary AWDB host is configured through the Finesse administration console.
Finesse can connect to the secondary AWDB host.
The Distributor service is running on the secondary AWDB host.

Agents and supervisors are authenticated against the AWDB database. When an agent or supervisor makes a successful API request (such as a sign-in request or call control request), the credentials are cached in Finesse for 30 minutes from the time of the request. After a user is authenticated, that user continues to be authenticated until 30 minutes pass, even if both AWDBs are down. Finesse attempts to reauthenticate the user against the AWDB only after the cache expires.

CUCM / LBG ? EMEA / Silent calls on 8841s when using EMCC

FAULT DETAILS
BT fault reference number: TAS000010116784
Business Impact: Medium 
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Customer has reported intermittent, yet regular, silent calls when dialling out using their Cisco 8841. The users in question are using Extn Mobility cross cluster and they also have call recording enabled. There is a detailed description of what exactly is happening below between the chevrons << >>. This detail below has been provied from Ravi Pal Singh. He said that something similar was investigated and solved before, but because this now involves EMCC, it?s another issue. What we would like to know if there is any other way of making this work without disabling Call Recording or upgrading CUCM? These are unfortunately not options for this customer currently.

<<<< 
As discussed, the issue here is quite similar to an old issue reported last year for LBG that relates to Jabber/SIP devices with call recording enabled . ( TAS000007419964) 

Jabber/SIP devices by default send all the codecs in the INVITE to CUCM . When CUCM receives this INVITE , it uses the same codec order that it receives from the SIP Client to create an outbound INVITE. This is because of the parameter in SIP Profile ?Accept Audio Codec Preferences in Received Offer? which as part of HCS design we have set to ON . In the previous case and this one ,  the phone is sending the codec order as ?0 8 116 18 101? i.e ulaw first and then alaw. CUCM leaf cluster uses the same codec order and sends the INVITE to SME , SME then forwards it on to SDIN. SDIN negotiate G711ulaw which is negotiated all the way back to the phone. 
As the phone has call recording enabled, CUCM Leaf Cluster sends re-INVITEs to both the phone and the SME so new recording streams can be established from the phone BiB. This is where the issue happens. In response to the re-INVITE from the SME , SDIN this time replies back with g711alaw instead of ulaw , which the SME forwards to CUCM LC and LC to the phone . However as the phone has already negotiated ulaw for recording it cannot change to alaw and sends a ?488 not acceptable media? . 

To resolve this a new SIP profile LBG Standard SIP Profile was created that had the ?Accept Audio Codec Preferences in Received Offer? set to OFF . This profile was applied to all Jabber devices and SIP phones on the Leaf Clusters . Unfortunately, this change will not work for SIP devices that log into a remote cluster . EMCC devices, as you know, do not register directly but appear as ?remotely logged in? devices on the home cluster. The remotely logged in devices use a different Database table whereas the CUCM makes use of a different DB entry to map a device with it?s assigned SIP profile. Therefore, the CUCM is not able to apply an EMCC SIP Profile to the remotely logged in device.

I took Suman?s help to test this in the NAL and unfortunately we couldn?t get this to work despite trying a lot of things . The SIP profile for an EMCC based phone is picked up from the EMCC template and we tried changing the profile on the template , changing the global service parameter , creating new users , updating all templates but none of it worked . Having checked internally, it appears that this was an issue with older CUCM releases i.e 10.5.2 and the way this works has been changed from CUCM 11.5 onwards . I am not sure what LBG?s upgrade plans are . I am aware the RAM/firmware upgrades for them have kicked off , but not sure if the UC APPs would be upgraded anytime soon.

EVENTS LEADING UP TO INFO
Were there any schedule work carried out: No
Were there any Network Outages experienced: No
Are there any issue(s) with firewall: No
INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT:
Any work carried out by BT to diagnose/troubleshoot fault: Yes. Test calls carried out from customer site. Traces and logs collected of affected calls.
Is it reproducible? YES or NO: YES ? test calls made from customer site 
If above is yes, state steps:
HCS phone makes either an internal or external call. The call connects, but there is silence in both directions entirely until either end hangs up. This is intermittent problem but seems to occur when calling to a variety of destination numbers such as 03459645645, 01217622415, 08009123123 etc.  See troubleshooting details for specifics.

FIPPA service is logging agents out after a couple of mins or less.

Impact:
There is no impact at the moment. FIPPA server is used as a backup in case Finesse Web does not work.

Steps Taken | Results: 

After looking at the FIPPA logs, I can see there seems to be a taks called ""UserForceLogoutScheduler"" that is running very 120 seconds which is causing the agent log out event.
